# Attack Data and Descriptions
There are 10 attacks that we ran on our 5G test bench, most of which rely on REST API calls to different parts of the core.

The *Attacks* directory contains each of the attacks, each divided into its own subdirectory. Within each attack is a *\*.pcapng* file beginning with "Attacks_" that contains only the attack packets present in the "allcap" file. Files not beginning with "Attacks_" may contain some benign, incidental traffic.

There are 3 attack types represented:
1. Reconnaissance attacks
2. Network reconfiguration attacks
3. Denial of Service attacks
